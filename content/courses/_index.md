I have served as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for the first two courses in a 3-term sequence of graduate statistics classes in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. These classes are designed to provide a thorough grounding in statistical concepts, methods, and applications of relevance to psychological science and related fields. The aim of these courses is to help students develop skills in the analysis and interpretation of real psychological data. The focuses of these classes is both conceptual and mathematical, as understanding the underlying mathematical principles of statistics enhances the ability to interpret and think critically about the use of statistics. The lab sections of these classes involve learning the basics of the statistical programming language R and how to use this program to wrangle, visualize and, summarize data and test hypotheses with inferential statistics.
