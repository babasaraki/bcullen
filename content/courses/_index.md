### UO Psych R Bootcamp 2020 
:link: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/

I organized and taught a 3-day introductory R Bootcamp for my fellow ducks in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon in September 2020.

This bootcamp gives a gentle introduction to R and RStudio, transforming and visualizing data with the tidyverse, and the basics of R Markdown. It assumes no prior experience with R or any other programming language and is designed to get learners up and running with the most widely useful tools for reproducible data analysis in R while emphasizing best practices for writing code and organizing project-oriented workflows.

### Introduction to Git and Github

:link: https://github.com/brendanhcullen/git-tutorial

I taught an introductory workshop for first-year psychology PhD and Master’s students on basics of using Git and Github for version control in February 2020. I also taught a more advanced version of this workshop for University of Oregon’s Data Science Club in , including a discussion of merge conflicts, branching, pull requests, and best practices for collaborative Github projects. I [regularly use Github](https://github.com/brendanhcullen) to more easily track and share my work, and I have enjoyed the opportunity to help my fellow grad students get started with learning the "why" and "how" of using version control.

### Undergraduate statistics

In spring 2020, I taught online lab sections for [PSY302: Statistical Methods in Psychology](psy302/PSY_302_Spring_2020.pdf), an introductory undergraduate statistics course (~200 students total). Below are a couple selected examples of lab sections that I taught using the open-source statistical software [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/). 

#### One-sample t-tests

### Graduate statistics

During Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 served as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for the first two courses in a 3-term sequence of graduate statistics classes in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. These classes are designed to provide a thorough grounding in statistical concepts, methods, and applications of relevance to psychological science and related fields. The lab sections of these classes involve learning the basics of the statistical programming language R and how to use this program to wrangle, visualize and, summarize data and test hypotheses with inferential statistics.
