I have served as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for the first two courses in a 3-term sequence of graduate statistics classes in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon designed to provide a thorough grounding in statistical concepts, methods, and applications of relevance to psychological science and related sciences. The aim of these courses is to help students develop skills in the analysis and interpretation of real psychological data. The focuses of these classes is both conceputual and mathematical – that is, understanding the underlying mathematical principles of statistics enhances ones’ ability to interpret and think critically about the use of statistics. These lab sections of these classes also involve learn the basics of the R language and use this program to wrangle, visualize, summarize, and test hypotheses with data.
