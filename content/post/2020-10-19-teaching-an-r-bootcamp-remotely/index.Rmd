# Background

Back in Fall 2018, the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon started to offer an introductory R Bootcamp the week before the start of the new academic year. The bootcamp consists of three 3-4 hour-long sessions that take place over the course of a week. The idea behind the bootcamp is to give a first exposure to R and programming in general to incoming students who have little to no background in these tools before being launched headfirst into having to use R to analyze data for their first year project and to complete labs and homework assignments for [PSY611](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/), the first in a series of graduate statistics courses taught entirely in R. 

In addition, as I've [written about previously](https://bcullen.rbind.io/post/2020-03-08-data-science-training-needs-in-grad-school/), current grad students, along with other members of the psychology department, have expressed interest in developing a stronger foundation in skills like basic programming, data wrangling, and data visualization. So the bootcamp also serves as an opportunity for those who want it to have a refresher and deeper dive into those topics.

After spending lot of time thinking about how to improve the data science learning experience for my fellow grad students and having [recently become](https://bcullen.rbind.io/post/2020-09-03-reflections-on-rstudio-instructor-training/) an [RStudio Certified Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/cullen+brendan/) in the tidyverse, it was my great privilege to be able to lead the 3rd Annual UO Psych Bootcamp this year. `r emo::ji("partying_face")` However, I found myself with a rather significant challenge. The R Bootcamp, like many introductory workshops, usually happens in-person in a large room with a giant project screen, coffee + snacks, and the ability to run over and look over someone's shoulder at their computer screen. Because of COVID-19, I found myself forced to design and deliver a bootcamp to a large group of beginners (many using R for the very first time) entirely over a webcam. Needless to say, this felt a little daunting `r emo::ji("fearful")`. Fortunately, there are many people out there who are experts in this sort of thing who have graciously shared their resources and advice, and this helped me immensely to prepare. 

:::reader
For anyone who is maybe new at teaching R, teaching online, or both, the goal of this post is to share with you some valuable lessons I learned and resources I used during this process to hopefully assist your own teaching experience.

# Who attended?

While the majority of those who attended were incoming first-year psychology grad students, we also had a mix of grad students at all levels, undergrads, research assistants, lab managers, staff data analysts, and faculty members from a variety of departments/centers, including Psychology, Linguistics, Economics and the Center for Translational Neuroscience.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# import bootcamp registration data 
registration <- read_csv("uopsych_bootcamp_registration_deidentified.csv")

# clean data
plot_data <- registration %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(position = what_is_your_position_at_uo,
         experience = do_you_have_any_experience_in_r_no_experience_is_required) %>%
  mutate(position = factor(case_when(position %in% c("Undergraduate", "Undergraduate student") ~ "Undergrad Student", 
                                     position %in% c("RA", "Lab Manager", "Data Analyst") ~ "Research Staff",
                              TRUE ~ as.character(position))),
         experience = factor(experience, levels = c(
           "I've never heard of it",
           "I've heard of it but have never used it",
           "I've opened it before",
           "I've used it to analyze data",
           "I use it often to analyze data")))

# plot positions at UO
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 15)) 
theme_update(legend.position = "none", 
          plot.title.position = "plot",
          panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())

plot_data %>% 
  count(position) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(position, n), n, fill = position)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal("Kotare")) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = "Participants' roles at University of Oregon")
```


```{r}
# plot prior experience 
plot_data %>% 
  count(experience) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(experience, n, fill = experience)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal("Kotare"))  + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = "Participants' prior experience with R")
```

# Logistics

To make the bootcamp materials more accessible and shareable, I decided to package them into a website, which I created using the `blogdown` package (see more on this below).

`r emo::ji("link")` <https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/", height = "500px")
```

# Tools I learned

:::: {.panelset}

### `xaringanExtra` `r emo::ji("package")` {.panel}

`r emo::ji("link")` https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/

`xaringanExtra`, by [Garrick Aden‑Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/) is one of my all-time favorite packages. Here are the features I use most often.

[Share again](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/share-again)

[Panelset](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset)

[Tile view](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/tile-view)

[Extra styles](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/extra-styles)


### `flair` `r emo::ji("package")` {.panel}

`r emo::ji("link")` https://r-for-educators.github.io/flair/index.html

Below is a demonstration of color-coding with `flair`. This also shows the "panelset" feature along with dynamic syntax highlighting from `xaringanExtra`.

![](xaringan_demo1.mov)

You can read more about other use cases for `flair` in this great [post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/flair/) on the RStudio Education Blog.

### `flipbookr` `r emo::ji("package")` {.panel}

`r emo::ji("link")` https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about

Here is a demo that shows "tile view" and `embed_xaringan()` in the context of a ggplot2 flipbook created with the `flipbookr` package.

# Encouragement & positivity

It's a common experience for

> "When I learned R, my advisor sent me this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and said 'get started'".


#### Anticipate the challenge 

```{r echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan("https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/slides/00-slides.html#10")
```

<br> 

#### Normalize errors & mistakes

```{r echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan("https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/slides/03-slides.html?panelset4=q14&panelset5=nrow2&panelset6=q15&panelset7=q16#60")
```

c.f. "positive error framing"

#### Make your materials friendly and inviting! 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("monster_support.jpg")
```

## Feedback

:::quote
"I really appreciated the warm welcome/atmosphere the instructors set up- learning a new programming language can be frustrating, especially for a beginner, so I was really appreciative of the continuous encouragement throughout the bootcamp."
:::

:::quote
"I really enjoyed how supportive and encouraging the facilitators were. I understood learning R was no easy endeavor but hearing about their experiences was encouraging for me. Also, I greatly appreciate all the amazing resources they have compiled for future use. I definitely plan to continue looking into it!"
:::

:::quote
"I appreciated the facilitators' organization, support, encouragement, and instructional clarity. Thank you for providing this very warm and accessible introduction for an absolute first-time novice! It's encouraged me to take more steps into learning R."

No matter how long someone has been using R, it never hurts to remind them (or yourself) that a little time and effort can go a really long way!
