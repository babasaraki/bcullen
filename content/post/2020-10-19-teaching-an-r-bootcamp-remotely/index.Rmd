# Background

Back in Fall 2018, the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon started to offer an introductory R Bootcamp the week before the start of the new academic year. It was my privilege to be able to lead the 3rd Annual UO Psych Bootcamp this year.

# Who attended?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# suspend authorization so no need for a token for accessing Google Drive data
googlesheets4::gs4_deauth()

# import bootcamp registration data 
registration <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wcGdQU7Vkg3XLvu0mArQx_gcSt0xHztbXmAmnj_tqmE/edit?usp=sharing")

# clean data
plot_data <- registration %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(position = what_is_your_position_at_uo,
         experience = do_you_have_any_experience_in_r_no_experience_is_required) %>%
  mutate(position = factor(case_when(position %in% c("Undergraduate", "Undergraduate student") ~ "Undergrad Student", 
                                     position %in% c("RA", "Lab Manager", "Data Analyst") ~ "Research Staff",
                              TRUE ~ as.character(position))),
         experience = factor(experience, levels = c(
           "I've never heard of it",
           "I've heard of it but have never used it",
           "I've opened it before",
           "I've used it to analyze data",
           "I use it often to analyze data")))

# plot positions at UO
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 15)) 
theme_update(legend.position = "none", 
          plot.title.position = "plot",
          panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())

plot_data %>% 
  count(position) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(position, n), n, fill = position)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal("Kotare")) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = "Participants' roles at University of Oregon")
```

Prior experience

```{r}
# plot prior experience 
plot_data %>% 
  count(experience) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(experience, n, fill = experience)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal("Kotare"))  + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = "Participants' prior experience with R")
```

# Logistics

To make the bootcamp materials more accessible and shareable, I decided to package them into a website, which I created from the `blogdown` package.

`r emo::ji("link")` <https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/", height = "500px")
```

# Resources & Recommendations

## Teaching tools

Below is a demonstration of color-coding with `flair`. This also shows the "panelset" feature along with dynamic syntax highlighting from `xaringanExtra`.

![](xaringan_demo1.mov)

Here is a demo that shows "tile view" and `embed_xaringan()` in the context of a ggplot2 flipbook created with the `flipbookr` package.

## Resources

# Feedback

It's a common experience for

"When I learned R, my advisor sent me this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and said 'get started'".

> "I really appreciated the warm welcome/atmosphere the instructors set up- learning a new programming language can be frustrating, especially for a beginner, so I was really appreciative of the continuous encouragement throughout the bootcamp."

> "I really enjoyed how supportive and encouraging the facilitators were. I understood learning R was no easy endeavor but hearing about their experiences was encouraging for me. Also, I greatly appreciate all the amazing resources they have compiled for future use. I definitely plan to continue looking into it!"

A little time and effort goes a long way!
